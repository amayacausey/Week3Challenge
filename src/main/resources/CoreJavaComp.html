<br><p><br>After learning a lot in Java, today we will discuss a new topic: comparison of core Java vs advanced Java.  Anyone who does or even knows superficially about programming might have the knowledge that Java is one of the foremost programming languages in the present times. It has oodles of features that justify why Java is preferred by not only veterans but newbies too.

    <br><br>Ever since its inception back in 1995, the class-based, object-oriented, high-level, general-purpose programming language has gone on to become not only of the most beloved but also one of the most influential programming languages in the world.

    <br><br>You can see lots of online discussion regarding the differences between core Java vs advanced Java online, on various web platforms.
    <br><br>Java technology is not only a programming language but also a platform. So, the Java platform is an environment that facilitates the execution of Java applications. Before advancing to draw the comparison between core Java vs advanced Java, let’s first explore the various Java platforms.
</p>
<br><h4>Java Platforms</h4><br>
<p>  There are 4 different platforms of the Java programming language. These are namely Java SE, Java EE, Java ME, and JavaFX. Each Java platform comes with a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and an API (Application Programming Interface).

    <br><br>The JVM, unlike the bytecode, is platform-dependent, can be understood as a program used for running Java applications. Different JVMs are meant to allow Java code to execute on different platforms. The Java API is analogous to a library, used for creating other software components.

    <br><br> Each Java platform comes with a distinct set of JVM and Java API. Hence, an application written for a specific platform is capable to run on any compatible system having the respective Java Virtual Machine.</p>
</div>
<ol>
    <li> Java Standard Edition (Java SE)</li>
    <p><br>Java SE API offers core functionality of the Java programming language. It defines everything from the basic data types, objects, and high-level classes used for database access, GUI development, networking, security, and XML parsing.
        Other than bundling JVM with the API, the Java Standard Edition comes with deployment technologies, development technologies, other class libraries, and toolkits.</p>
    <p>Core Java is Oracle’s definition of referring to a subset of Java SE technologies. In actual, the term core Java is not related to the Java programming language on a technical level, it is but a set of some basic packages. At present, the Java Core is defined as having:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Application monitoring and management</li>
        <li>Basic technologies</li>
        <li>CORBA</li>
        <li>HotSpot VM</li><br>
    </ul>

    <li>Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)</li>
   <br> <p>The Java Enterprise Edition platform is built on top of the Java SE. Like SE, Java EE platform comes with an API, JVM, and JRE (Java Runtime Environment) for developing and running applications that are highly reliable, multi-tiered, scalable, and robustly secure.</p>
     <li>Java Micro Edition (Java ME)</li>
    <p><br>Although like its siblings, the Java ME comes with an API and a JVM, the main distinguishing factor is the tiny footprint of the bundled Java Virtual Machine. Typically, Java ME apps are clients of Java EE platform services.

        <br>Java ME platform is specifically designed for developing applications for mobile platforms, such as smartphones and tablets. The Java ME API is a subset of the Java SE API. Additionally, it comes with special class libraries designed for small device application development.</p>
    <li> JavaFX</li>
    <p><br>We use the lightweight JavaFX API for creating rich Internet applications. Applications designed with the JavaFX platform make use of hardware-accelerated graphics as well as media engines.

        In order to connect to networked data sources, JavaFX apps use high-level APIs. Usually, JavaFX applications are clients of Java EE platform services.</p>

</ol>

<h3>Core Java vs Advanced Java</h3>

<br><p>Here you will see a feature-wise comparison of core Java vs advanced Java –</p>
<br><ol>
    <li>Definition</li>
    <br><p>What is Core Java? – Core Java is the fundamental form of Java. We use it in all Java platforms and technologies. Without going through core Java, it is impossible to advance to advanced Java.

        <br>What is Advanced Java? – Unlike core Java, advanced Java is a specialization of the core Java in some particular domain, such as database handling, networking, and the web.</p>
    <li>Applications Developed</li>
    <br><p>Core Java covers the fundamental concepts of Java programming language for developing general applications. Advanced Java, on the other hand, covers advanced topics pertaining to Java programming language that helps in building enterprise-level applications.

    <br>Applications developed using core Java are typically standalone applications meant to be either cross-platform or platform-specific. Simply, core Java helps in building general applications, such as a student attendance management system, EMI calculator, or the classic snake game.

    <br>On the contrary, applications developed using advanced Java are those that enterprises use or are at an enterprise-level. This includes apps that run on servers i.e. web applications.</p>
    <li>Architecture</li>
    <br><p>The core Java makes use of single-tier architecture. On the flip side, advanced Java uses instances of two-tier architecture, such as client-server architecture.

   <br> In a one-tier architecture, the data stores in the local system or a shared drive. It has all the layers, such as Business, Data Access, and Presentation.

    <br>An architecture where the presentation layer or the interface layer runs on a client while the data layer or the data structure stores on a server called as a two-tier architecture.</p>
    <li>Java Packages</li>
    <br><p>All core Java packages have a naming convention of java.lang.somepackage. On the contrary, packages for advance Java follows javax.servlet.somepackage.</p>
<li>Knowledge</li><br>
<p>Typically, there are three levels of Java knowledge, namely Java, core Java, and advanced Java. Hence, both core Java and advanced Java differ in terms of knowledge.
<ul>
    <li>Java – The basic level. This is where one learns how to write a Hello World program in Java and create basic Java programs.</li>
    <li>Core Java – It is the level in Java proficiency required as a minimum for getting a job. At this level, one needs to have an expertise in Java Collections, Java Exception Handling, Java Multi-threading, OOPS, Polymorphism, et cetera</li>
<li> Advanced Java – In addition to knowledge of core Java, one needs to have a sound understanding of various related packages and advanced concepts, such as JSON parsing, REST service creation, and XML handling</li>
</ul>
   </p>
    <p>For those looking to transcend from advanced Java, there is the architect level. Learning frameworks like Hibernate, Java Design Patterns, and Spring becomes mandatory at this level.</p>
    <li>Platform Choice</li>
    <br><p>While the Java Standard Edition (Java SE) comes under core Java, advanced Java encompasses the Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE).</p>
<li>Topics Covered</li>
    <br><p>Core Java covers basic concepts and topics pertaining to the Java programming language. This includes data types, exception handling, operators, and threading.

   <br> On the other hand, advanced Java entails complex topics and concepts that require non-Java technologies. Some notable examples are database connectivity, EJB, JSP, servlets, and web services.</p>

</ol>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<br><p>So, that completes the comparison between core Java vs advanced Java. While the former is the fundamental part of the Java programming language, the latter is the former plus advanced concepts and a web-based approach.

    There is no denying the fact that making a clear distinction between core Java and advanced Java is a daunting task. However, the above-mentioned points will certainly make your understanding about the two types of Java better, at least, slightly.</p>
